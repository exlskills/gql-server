# EXLskills GraphQL API Server

## Requirements

You may be able to get away with more/less than what's described below, but we can't recommend anything outside of these options:

Operating Systems:

- Ubuntu 16.04
- OS X 10.13+
- Windows has not been thoroughly tested, although it has worked and should work... Windows-related contributions are welcome

Other Dependencies:

- MongoDB v3.4+ (Recommend v3.6+)
- NodeJS v8.10+
- NPM v6.1+

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/exlskills/gql-server

cd gql-server

npm install
```

## Running

MongoDB should be running

Set up generated files:

```
npm run update-schema
```

TODO discuss seeding data

Start a local server:

```
npm start
```

### Configuration

At startup, the server reads the configuration information from the Operating System's Environment Variables and/or from the `.env` file located in the installation root directory. See [dotenv syntax rules](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#rules) for `.env` formatting. The same format is also generally applicable to [docker environment variables files](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file) that can be used to pass parameters into containers via `--env-file` option and to [docker-compose environment file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#env_file) 

For local testing or development, copy the sample provided `.default.env` into `.env` and set the necessary values, e.g., set
```
DB_NAME=my_dev
```

## GraphQL Schema

If at any time you make changes to `src/schema.js` or `src/relay-*/*.js`, stop the server,
regenerate `src/schema.graphql`, and restart the server:

```
npm run update-schema
npm start
```

## Course Delivery Schedule Loader API

The API provides functionality to load Course Delivery Schedule into the system from a YAML file formatted as per `src/data-load/course-delivery-schedule/data/course-delivery-sample.yaml`. The content of file is pulled from the GitHub repository and then pushed back ("feedback commit") with the record IDs written into the file to facilitate updates and reloads.    

The API is invoked via POST to `/course-delivery-schedule`    

As the process needs write access to the repository containing the YAML file, environment variable `GITHUB_USER_TOKEN` should be set according to [GitHub Personal Access Token setup](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). According to the [JS gihub API documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/rest), only the token is used in the authentication call, the GitHub User ID is not required. 
Additionally, environment variable `GITHUB_WH_TOKEN` should be set with the value matching the [GitHub webhook secret](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/)    

The commit to the GitHub repository should contain only the schedule file(s) - the API is coded to process the entire content of the commit, as per the GitHub webhook, except any files that contain `README` or `LICENSE` in their name, case-insensitive, as well as `.gitignore`. The return codes are: 
- 200 - success 
- 304 - bypassing webhook generated by the feedback commit or no files to process in the commit (e.g., README only was committed) 
- 400 - malformed request body, payload or X-Hub-Signature does not match expected value 
- 403 - GitHub user token authentication error  
- 422 - error creating feedback commit 
- 500 - other error
